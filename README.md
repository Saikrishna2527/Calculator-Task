The task is to build a Calculator CLI App using Python. 
It can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.
Mainly this task involves:
        Writing a Python script (usually named calculator.py) that acts as a simple calculator.
        Accepting user input: The program will prompt the user to select an operation (such as addition or subtraction) and input two numbers.
        Processing user choices: The script will determine which operation to perform based on the input.
        Performing calculations: The script uses functions that perform the required calculation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
        Displaying results: The program outputs the result of the calculation.
        Handling errors: The code should manage invalid inputs (such as division by zero or non-numeric input) gracefully.
        
Example Flow:
The program prints a menu:
1)Add
2)Subtract
3)Multiply
4)Divide
The user selects an operation (e.g., 3 for multiplication).
The user is asked to enter two numbers.
The program prints the result.
It asks if the user wants another calculation; if not, it exits.
